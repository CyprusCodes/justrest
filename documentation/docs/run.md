# Running The Project

To run the project within **XEST** framework;

```bash
$ xx run
```

Which should start the docker, set up the database schema and start the project giving the following output;

```bash
Creating network "database_default" with the default driver
Creating volume "database_vol-project-name-db" with default driver
Creating project-name-mysql-db ...
Creating project-name-mysql-db ... done
Waiting for MySQL Container to become ready. This should only take a few seconds.
Setting up your database schema.
Populating database with seed data.

```

- If your project didn't start or gives an error like this

**Docker is currently not running. Please start Docker and repeat xx run again.**

You need to **restart** your *Docker*.

### Stop the project

If at any point you want to stop the project, such in case of updating the `seed-data.sql`, you can do with going into your terminal and pressing **ctrl + c**.

This will stop your *Docker*, API and the MYSQL container.
