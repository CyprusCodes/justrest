# Refresh the project

If at any point you want to refresh the project, such in case of updating the `seed-data.sql` or you made changes within the **MySQL Workbench** but want to refresh your API database you can do so with the following command;

```bash
$ xx fresh
```

This will restart the project with the original data.
