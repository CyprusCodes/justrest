# Nodejs

Xest framework uses *Nodejs* runtime for its CLI and also Expressjs behind the scenes for the API setup.

## Installing Nodejs with NVM

We suggest that you use node version manager [nvm](https://heynode.com/tutorial/install-nodejs-locally-nvm/) to install Nodejs on your machine.

We recommend using Node v14+ and higher whilst using Xest.
