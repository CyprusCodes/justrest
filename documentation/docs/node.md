# Node/NPM

**XEST** framework uses *node* framework in the background which allows our Javascript code to run on our machine.

**XEST** framework uses *npm* which automatically is being downloaded when you install the **XEST** framework.

## Node Version Manager - NVM

We suggest that you use node version manager, [nvm](https://heynode.com/tutorial/install-nodejs-locally-nvm/), you can install and manage *node* packages with *nvm* . It would be handy to use *nvm*  while using **XEST** framework.
