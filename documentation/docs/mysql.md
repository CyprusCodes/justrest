## Database Management Tools

Even though you do not need to download MySQL, in order to architech your database we suggest you download either [MySQL Workbench](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/workbench/) or [BeeKeeper Studio](https://www.beekeeperstudio.io/get) database management softwares.

You can use either one of them to architect, develop, edit, update, delete, create, read, model, design your data from your databases.
