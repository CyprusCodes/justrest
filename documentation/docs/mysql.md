# MySQL

Xest framework uses *MySQL* within *Docker*. This means you don't need to install MySQL separately to your development machine.

When you start your Xest project with `xx run` or `xx fresh` commands, your database is automaticaly architectured and populated with the seed data using `database-schema.sql` and `seed-data.sql` files.

## Database Management Tools

Even though you do not need to download MySQL, in order to architect your database we suggest you download either [MySQL Workbench](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/workbench/) or [BeeKeeper Studio](https://www.beekeeperstudio.io/get) database management applications.
