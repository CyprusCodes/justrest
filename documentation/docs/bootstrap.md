# Bootstrapping a new Xest Project

Once you have installed the **Xest** CLI with

```bash
$ npm install xest -g
```

You can bootstrap your API project with the following command

```bash
$ xx [project-name]
```

Then navigate to your API directory

```bash
$ cd [project-name]
```

Have a look at the generated files and directory structure.
