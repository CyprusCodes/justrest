# Bootstrapping a new Xest Project

Once you have installed the **Xest** framework with;

```bash
$ npm install xest -g
```

You can start with creating your directory and running your project with;

```bash
$ xx [project-name]
```

Then;

```bash
$ cd [project-name]
```

Have a look at your files and file structure.
